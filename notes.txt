seems like i have a "captured" arg in initializing a piece object.
and it sets self.exists to false.
and it's used in clear() square method

that looks very odd, possibly gonna cause big bug not sure what i had in mind there :p

so if you move a piece, and clear previous start square after legit move, you should clear that squares piece object
maybe i just called it caputre by mistake, need to figure how its actually used in game flow.

what is left:
en pessant
promoting pawns
is king in check method
if that method is true, check if it's mate
castling rights and castling as a move - this will be fun :p

edge case in king trying to capture a bishop, is deemed illegal
-> just check if desti square at the same pos as aggressor piece
another, is square attacked, fails to return true if the square is moving away from piece that gave us check.

edge case, if in check allow moving other pieces if they capture the piece
and get you out of check by doing so

refactored get_path for consistent return type, now [] no path when in reality it's a square next to you, so I will return None if it actually broke mid way

impelemnt get path to comply with knights edgecase for asserting pin state, knights are kinda ignored in get path because they jump over stuff
