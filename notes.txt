seems like i have a "captured" arg in initializing a piece object.
and it sets self.exists to false.
and it's used in clear() square method

that looks very odd, possibly gonna cause big bug not sure what i had in mind there :p

so if you move a piece, and clear previous start square after legit move, you should clear that squares piece object
maybe i just called it caputre by mistake, need to figure how its actually used in game flow.

what is left:
en pessant
promoting pawns
is king in check method
if that method is true, check if it's mate
castling rights and castling as a move - this will be fun :p

edge case in king trying to capture a bishop, is deemed illegal
another, is square attacked, fails to return true if the square is moving away from piece that gave us check.
