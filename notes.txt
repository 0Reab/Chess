current issue is having squares initialize as none causes every square.method to throw an error, fair enough
so what do I do 

have square still initialize as their objects, and have square.method available -> but method for checking if square is populated needs to be fixed

into something like -> return True if self.piece. else False

solved that none tpye dumb bug

piece movement, consider all possible moves like pawn captures diagonally
prune those moves if destination square is not ocupied by opponents piece
or if the pawn moved already then it cannot go two squares forward
